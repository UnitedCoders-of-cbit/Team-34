            <h1 class="h1">What is Python?</h1>
            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
            
            It is used for:
            
            web development (server-side),
            software development,
            mathematics,
            system scripting.
            What can Python do?
            Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
            Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
            Why Python?
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
            Good to know
            The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
            In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
            Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
            Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
            Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
            Example
            print("Hello, World!")
        </pre>

            Execute Python Syntax
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

Python Indentation
Python Variables
Python Comments
Exercises
Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py
Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

Example
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")

        <h1 class="Head">python variables</h1>
        <pre class="para">
            In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Example
Variables in Python:

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

You will learn more about variables in the Python Variables chapter.

Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Example
Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

 <div id="PythonDatatypes">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">Python Data Types</h1>
        <h3>Basic Data Types</h3>
<pre class="para"> 
    Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType
Getting the Data Type
You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

Example
Print the data type of the variable x:

x = 5
print(type(x))
Setting the Data Type
In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

Example	Data Type	Try it
x = "Hello World"	str	
x = 20	int	
x = 20.5	float	
x = 1j	complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	tuple	
x = range(6)	range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset	
x = True	bool	
x = b"Hello"	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview	
x = None	NoneType       
</pre>
    </div>
 </div>

 <div id="CVariables">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">C variables</h1>
        <h3>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h3>
        <pre class="para">
            
To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:

Syntax
type variableName = value;
Where type is one of C types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable.

So, to create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign the value 15 to it:

int myNum = 15;
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

Example
int myNum;
myNum = 15;
Note: If you assign a new value  to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:

Example
int myNum = 15;  // myNum is 15
myNum = 10;  // Now myNum is 10
Output Variables
You learned from the output chapter that you can output values/print text with the printf() function:

Example
printf("Hello World!");
In many other programming languages (like Python, Java, and C++), you would normally use a print function to display the value of a variable. However, this is not possible in C:
        </pre>
        
            
    </div>
 </div>

 <div id="CConstants">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">C Constants</h1>
        <h3>Constants</h3>
        <pre class="para">
            When you don't want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

Example
const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'
You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:

Example
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;
Notes On Constants
When you declare a constant variable, it must be assigned with a value:

Example
Like this:

const int minutesPerHour = 60;
This however, will not work:

const int minutesPerHour;
minutesPerHour = 60; // error
Good Practice
Another thing about constant variables, is that it is considered good practice to declare them with uppercase. It is not required, but useful for code readability and common for C programmers:

Example
const int BIRTHYEAR = 1980;
        </pre>
    </div>
 </div>

 <div id="COperators">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">C Operators</h1>
        <h3>Operators</h3>
        <pre class="para">
            Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

Example
int myNum = 100 + 50;
Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
C divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x	
Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;
The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;
        </pre>
    </div> 
 </div>

 

 <div id="CLoops">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class ="Head">Loops</h1>
        <h3>While Loop</h3>
        <pre class="para">The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

            Syntax
            while (condition) {
              // code block to be executed
            }
            In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
            
            Example
            int i = 0;
            
            while (i < 5) {
              printf("%d\n", i);
              i++;
            }
            Note: Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition (i++), otherwise the loop will never end!
            
            The Do/While Loop
            The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
            
            Syntax
            do {
              // code block to be executed
            }
            while (condition);
            The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
            
            Example
            int i = 0;
            
            do {
              printf("%d\n", i);
              i++;
            }
            while (i < 5);
            Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!</pre>
    </div>
 </div>

 <div id="CArray">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">C Arrays</h1>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <pre class="para">
            Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].

To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
We have now created a variable that holds an array of four integers.

Access the Elements of an Array
To access an array element, refer to its index number.

Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.

This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers:

Example
int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);

// Outputs 25
Change an Array Element
To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:

Example
myNumbers[0] = 33;
Example
int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
myNumbers[0] = 33;

printf("%d", myNumbers[0]);

// Now outputs 33 instead of 25
Loop Through an Array
You can loop through the array elements with the for loop.

The following example outputs all elements in the myNumbers array:

Example
int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};
int i;

for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", myNumbers[i]);
}
Set Array Size
Another common way to create arrays, is to specify the size of the array, and add elements later:

Example
// Declare an array of four integers:
int myNumbers[4];

// Add elements
myNumbers[0] = 25;
myNumbers[1] = 50;
myNumbers[2] = 75;
myNumbers[3] = 100;
Using this method, you should know the size of the array, in order for the program to store enough memory.

You are not able to change the size of the array after creation

 <div id="Cstrings">
    <div class="main">
        <h1 class="Head">C Strings</h1>
        <h3>string</h3>
        <pre class="para">Strings are used for storing text/characters.

            For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters.
            
            Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. Instead, you must use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:
            
            char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
            Note that you have to use double quotes ("").
            
            To output the string, you can use the printf() function together with the format specifier %s to tell C that we are now working with strings:
            
            Example
            char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
            printf("%s", greetings);
            Access Strings
            Since strings are actually arrays in C, you can access a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].
            
            This example prints the first character (0) in greetings:
            
            Example
            char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
            printf("%c", greetings[0]);
            Note that we have to use the %c format specifier to print a single character.
            
            Modify Strings
            To change the value of a specific character in a string, refer to the index number, and use single quotes:
            
            Example
            char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
            greetings[0] = 'J';
            printf("%s", greetings);
            // Outputs Jello World! instead of Hello World!
            Another Way Of Creating Strings
            In the examples above, we used a "string literal" to create a string variable. This is the easiest way to create a string in C.
            
            You should also note that you can create a string with a set of characters. This example will produce the same result as the example in the beginning of this page:
            
            Example
            char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
            printf("%s", greetings);
            Why do we include the \0 character at the end? This is known as the "null terminating character", and must be included when creating strings using this method. It tells C that this is the end of the string.
            
            Differences
            The difference between the two ways of creating strings, is that the first method is easier to write, and you do not have to include the \0 character, as C will do it for you.
            
            You should note that the size of both arrays is the same: They both have 13 characters (space also counts as a character by the way), including the \0 character:
            
            Example
            char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
            char greetings2[] = "Hello World!";
            
            printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings));   // Outputs 13
            printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings2));  // Outputs 13</pre>
